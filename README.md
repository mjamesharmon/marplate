# Marplate
*A Minimalist Slide/Presentation Template*/

Marplate is for developers (or anyone else) who dislike using tools like PowerPoint for presentations and just want to stick with the tools they already know and love.  It's a markdown-based slide template optimized for use with VS Code (or the editor of your choiceâ€¦ hullo VI). Built on the [Marp Presentation Ecosystem](https://marp.app/) and the [.NET Core Template Engine](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/), Marplate is a minimalist solution that simplifies formatting and layout, so you can focus on creating beautiful presentations.

## Requirements
- .Net 6 or better
