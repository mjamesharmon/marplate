# Marplate
*A Minimalist Slide/Presentation Template*

Marplate is for developers (or anyone else) who dislike using tools like PowerPoint for presentations and just want to stick with the tools they already know and love.  It's a markdown-based slide template optimized for use with VS Code (or the editor of your choiceâ€¦ hullo VI). Built on the [Marp Presentation Ecosystem](https://marp.app/) and the [.NET Core Template Engine](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/), Marplate is a minimalist solution that simplifies formatting and layout, so you can focus on creating beautiful presentations.

## VS Code Slide Templates
Several templates are provided for quickly adding slides to a presentation:

|  Name  | Command   | Result    |   
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Basic Slide | `slide` |  Inserts a slide with heading and two columns, text on the left and an image on the right. |
| Title Slide | `title` |  Inserts a title slide with title text to the left and a main image to the right. |
| Code Slide | `code` | Inserts a slide with a heading, description and a section of code. |
| Blank Slide | `blank` | Inserts a blank slide. |


## Usage Example: Basic Slide
This example demonstrates how to insert a two column slide containing a heading, supporting text and an image.

 ```console
   ---
   # My heading
   Some text here
   and here
   and here
   ![bg right:50% 50%](img/01.jpg)
 ```
 
This slide template is accessible in VS Code by typing `slide` in the editor and selecting `Basic Slide` 

## Creating PDF, PowerPoint or HTML Slide Decks from VS Code
The Marp extension in VS Code allows you to export Marplate slides as PDF, Powerpoint or HTML slide decks.
From the Command Pallete choose `Marp: Export Slide Deck...` and choose the desired format.
